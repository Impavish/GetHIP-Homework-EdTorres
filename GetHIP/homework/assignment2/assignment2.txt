| You are contracted to work with the local university to write scientific software for the exciting research		|
| field of basic geometry. You will model 5 shapes and provide researchers with the ability to calculate areas		|
| and display statistics on the fly.											|
| There are high expectations for quality and we will be grading your software based on three criteria:	                |
|                                                                                                                       |
|       1. All requirements must be met                                                                                 |
|       2. Quality of code and comments                                                                                 |
|       3. Number of bugs                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                       |
| Programs must compile to be accepted.                                                                                 |

Requirements:

        1. Create an abstract class named Shape.java containing the following:
		- private String shapeType, will be "Triangle", "Quadrilateral" or "Circle"
		- Getter and setter for shapeType variable, named getShapeType() and setShapeType(String type)
		- private String shapeName, will be name of the shape i.e. "Rectangle" or "Rhombus"
		- Getter and setter for shapeName variable, named getShapeName() and setShapeName(String name)
		- Method getArea() which returns the area as a double

	2. Create an interface called Printable.java containing the following:
		- Method printDescription() which prints out all attributes of the shape
                
        3. Create five classes that extend Shape and implement Printable
		- Circle.java
		- Triangle.java
		- Rectangle.java
		- Rhombus.java
		- Trapezoid.java

        4. You will need to create extra variables to store the properties of each shape.
	   To ensure consistancy, the constructors have been provided:
		- public Circle(int radius){ ... }
		- public Triangle(int base, int height){ ... }
		- public Rectangle(int height, int width){ ... }
		- public Rhombus(int diagonalA, int diagonalB){ ... }
		- public Trapezoid(int baseA, int baseB, int height){ ... }

        5. The main method class will be provided for you in a seperate file

Notes:
	- Area of a circle = pi * r^2
	- Area of a triangle = (h * b) / 2
	- Area of a rectangle = h * w
	- Area of a rhombus = (d1 * d2) / 2
	- Area of a trapezoid = ((b1 + b2) / 2) * h

	- Make sure your method names match the method names in the runner if you see errors when compiling

Example output:

Calculating circle area:
Area = 113.1
Printing circle description:
Type is Circle. 
Radius is 6 units.

Calculating triangle area:
Area = 12
Printing triangle description:
Type is Triangle.
Base is 6 units.
Height is 4 units.

Calculating rectangle area:
Area = 24
Printing rectangle description:
Type is Quadrilateral.
Height is 8 units.
Width is 3 units.

Calculating Rhombus area:
Area = 15
Type is Quadrilateral.
Diagonal A is 6 units.
Diagonal B is 5 units.

Calculating Trapezoid area:
Area = 35
Type is Quadrilateral.
Base A is 4.
Base B is 10.
Height is 5.
