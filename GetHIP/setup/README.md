##Java Development Environment Setup

####Java JDK Install
[Install the Java JDK (latest version)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Once the JDK is installed it will be helpful to add the JDK's bin folder to the System variable path.

(on a Windows Operating System)
  1. Go to *Computer*.
  2. Open *System properties*.
  3. Open *Advanced System settings*.
  4. Open *Environment Variables...*.
  5. Under *System variables* find and select the variable *Path* and click edit.
  6. Add a semicolon *;* to the end of the *Variable value* and then add the location of your JDK's bin directory. ex. "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\bin"

To check if your install and setup were successfull, open command prompt and type the command *java -version* and *javac -version*.

####Git Install
[Install the Git client (latest version)](https://git-scm.com/download/)

Use the default options when installing Git unless you feel the other options may provide some benefit.

####Notepad++
This is optional, and you may already have a preferred text editor, but Notepad++ is a very simple, yet powerful, text editor that fully supports most file types.
